**Expediting** is an automated threat. The OWASP Automated Threat Handbook - Web Applications ([pdf](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/tree/master/assets/files/EN), [print](http://www.lulu.com/shop/owasp-foundation/automated-threat-handbook/paperback/product-23540699.html)), an output of the [OWASP Automated Threats to Web Applications Project](../../../), provides a fuller guide to each threat, detection methods and countermeasures. The [threat identification chart](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/files/oat-ontology-decision-chart.pdf) helps to correctly identify the automated threat.

<img alt="Indicative diagram for OAT-006" src="images/500px-OAT-006_Expediting.png" style="background-color:#eeeeee;padding:1em;">

### Description
Using speed to violate explicit or implicit assumptions about the applicationâ€™s normal use to achieve unfair individual gain, often associated with deceit and loss to some other party.

In contrast to [OAT-016 Skewing](OAT-016_Skewing.html) which affects metrics, Expediting is purely related to faster progression through a series of application processes. And [OAT-017 Spamming](OAT-017_Spamming.html) is different to Expediting, since the focus of spam is to add information, and may not involve the concept of process progression.
