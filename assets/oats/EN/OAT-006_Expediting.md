**Expediting** is an automated threat. The OWASP Automated Threat Handbook - Web Applications ([pdf](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/tree/master/assets/files/EN), [print](http://www.lulu.com/shop/owasp-foundation/automated-threat-handbook/paperback/product-23540699.html)), an output of the [OWASP Automated Threats to Web Applications Project](../../../), provides a fuller guide to each threat, detection methods and countermeasures. The [threat identification chart](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/files/oat-ontology-decision-chart.pdf) helps to correctly identify the automated threat.

<img alt="Indicative diagram for OAT-006" src="images/500px-OAT-006_Expediting.png" style="background-color:#eeeeee;padding:1em;">

### Description
Using speed to violate explicit or implicit assumptions about the application’s normal use to achieve unfair individual gain, often associated with deceit and loss to some other party.

In contrast to [OAT-016 Skewing](OAT-016_Skewing.html) which affects metrics, Expediting is purely related to faster progression through a series of application processes. And [OAT-017 Spamming](OAT-017_Spamming.html) is different to Expediting, since the focus of spam is to add information, and may not involve the concept of process progression.
