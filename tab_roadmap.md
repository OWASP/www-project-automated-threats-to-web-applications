## Road Map and Getting Involved

We want to keep the Automated Threat Handbook Updated. As of spring 2025, we are updating the CAPEC and OWASP mappings and undertaking a review to identify mappings to [Open Common Requirement Enumeration (Open CRE)](https://www.opencre.org).

A new edition will be published in April-May 2025.

Can you help? The project is looking for information on the prevalence and types of automated threats seen by web application owners in the real world. This will be used to refine and organise the information gathered from research papers, whitepapers, security reports and industry news. Please use the project's [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/automated-threats-project) to keep up-to-date with what's going on, and to contribute your ideas, feedback, and experience:

To share information confidentially, you can email the project leaders directly: [Tin Zaw](mailto:tin.zaw@owasp.org) and [Colin Watson](mailto:colin.watson@owasp.org).
