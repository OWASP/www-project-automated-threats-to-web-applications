<p>The OWASP Automated Threats to Web Applications Project has completed a review of reports, academic and other papers, news stories and vulnerability taxonomies/listings to identify, name and classify these scenarios – automated by software causing a divergence from accepted behavior producing one or more undesirable effects on a web application, but excluding tool-based exploitation of single-issue vulnerabilities. The initial objective was to produce an ontology providing a common language for developers, architects, operators, business owners, security engineers, purchasers and suppliers/ vendors, to facilitate clear communication and help tackle the issues. The project also identifies symptoms, mitigations and controls in this problem area. Like all OWASP outputs, everything is free and published using an open source license.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Web applications are subjected to unwanted automated usage – day in, day out. Often these events relate to misuse of inherent valid functionality, rather than the attempted exploitation of unmitigated vulnerabilities. Also, excessive misuse is commonly mistakenly reported as application denial-of-service (DoS) like HTTP-flooding, when in fact the DoS is a side-effect instead of the primary intent. Frequently these have sector-specific names. Most of these problems seen regularly by web application owners are not listed in any OWASP Top Ten or other top issue list. Furthermore, they are not enumerated or defined adequately in existing dictionaries. These factors have contributed to inadequate visibility, and an inconsistency in naming such threats, with a consequent lack of clarity in attempts to address the issues.</p>
<p>Without sharing a common language between devops, architects, business owners, security engineers, purchasers and suppliers/vendors, everyone has to make extra effort to communicate clearly. Misunderstandings can be costly. The adverse impacts affect the privacy and security of individuals as well as the security of the applications and related system components.</p>

# Scope and Definitions

## Scope

The aim was to create a listing of vendor-neutral and technology
agnostic terms that describe real-world automated threats to web
applications, at a level of abstraction that application owners can
relate to. These terms are threat events to web applications undertaken
using automated actions.

The focus is on abuse of functionality - misuse of inherent
functionality and related design flaws, some of which are also referred
to as business logic flaws. There is almost no focus on implementation
bugs. It is not that the latter are not the target for attacks, but
there is much more knowledge published in that area with a greater
agreement on terminology. All the scenarios identified must require the
web to exist for the threat to be materialised. Many of the scenarios
have impacts upon the organisation that owns or operates web
applications, but some scenarios have impacts more focused on
individuals or other bodies. An attack that can be achieved without the
web is out of scope.

## Definitions

### Automated Threats to Web Applications

Threat events to web applications undertaken using automated actions.

An attack that can be achieved without the web is out of scope.

## Glossary

  - Action
    An act taken against an asset by a threat agent. Requires first that
    contact occurs between the asset and threat agent (Ref 1)

<!-- end list -->

  - Application
    Software that performs a business process i.e. not system software
    A software program hosted by an information system (Ref 2)

<!-- end list -->

  - Application layer
    "Layer 7” in the OSI model (Ref 3) and “application layer” in the
    TCP/IP model (Ref 4)

<!-- end list -->

  - Threat
    Anything that is capable of acting in a manner resulting in harm to
    an asset and/or organization; for example, acts of God (weather,
    geological events, etc.); malicious actors; errors; failures (Ref 1)

<!-- end list -->

  - Threat Agent
    Any agent (e.g., object, substance, human, etc.) that is capable of
    acting against an asset in a manner that can result in harm (Ref 1)

<!-- end list -->

  - Threat Event
    Occurs when a threat agent acts against an asset (Ref 1)

<!-- end list -->

  - Web
    The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in
    which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are
    identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers
    (URI) (Ref 5)
    The first three specifications for Web technologies defined URLs,
    HTTP, and HTML (Ref 6)

<!-- end list -->

  - Web application
    An application delivered over the web

# Use Case Scanarios

The following scenarios and organisation names are completely
fictitious.

## Defining application development security requirements

Cinnaminta SpA intends to build and launch a new multi-lingual and
multi-currency ecommerce website. The development will be outsourced and
Cinnaminta has been working on the functional design document. Among
many other requirements, the application security specification requires
that the website must not include any vulnerabilities identified in PCI
DSS v3.1 Requirement 6.5, nor any other vulnerabilities that could
affect the protection of payment cardholder data. Cinnaminta specifies
that the website's payment functions must not be susceptible to the
threat events **OAT-001 Carding** or **OAT-010 Card Cracking** as
defined in the **OWASP Automated Threat Handbook**. In addition, the
application must interact with the company's existing fraud detection
system to counter **OAT-012 Cashing Out**. The requirements are
specified in terms of these threat events, rather than particular
product or service categories. Development houses responding to the call
for bids use the ontology to focus their answers to these aspects
appropriately.

## Sharing intelligence within a sector

Unlimited Innovations Inc develops and supports patient-facing software
solutions to a range of healthcare providers, many of which participate
in the National Health Service Cyber Intelligence Sharing Center
(NHS-CISC). Unlimited Innovations already builds continuous monitoring
capabilities into its software and decides to provide an optional
enhancement so that customers could choose to share their misuse event
data with each other, to benefit from the combined threat intelligence.
Rather than sharing large quantities of low-level data, Unlimited
Innovations aggregates information and broadcasts validated and
categorised threat data amongst the participating organisations.
Automation attacks are classified according to the threat events defined
in the **OWASP Automated Threat Handbook** so that each receiving party
understands the nature of the threat. Even organisations that do not
want to take part in this information sharing can benefit, since their
own categorised information is made available to internal business
management in the form of an easy-to-comprehend monitoring dashboard.
The information gathered can also be fed into their other business
information management systems to help improve patient service.

## Exchanging threat data between CERTs

National Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) recognise that
sharing of local information can contribute to worldwide prevention of
cyber attacks. Despite advances in cooperation between CERTs, anything
to increase continuity and interoperability, such as standards for data
exchange, is encouraged. CERT Zog is concerned about the sparsity of
application-specific data it receives, and also the classification of
that data. It has a particular concern about attacks and breaches that
affect sectors defined in Zog's 2015 national cyber security strategy.
CERT Zog and its neighbour CERT Tarset agree to tag threat events using
the **OWASP Automated Threat Handbook** in order to add greater context
to existing solutions being used for threat data exchange between them.
The programme also collects sector metadata, so that all organisations
within these can benefit from the centralised intelligence.

## Enhancing application penetration test findings

Specialist application security penetration testing firm Cherak
Industries Pte Ltd works primarily for financial services companies in
the banking and insurance sectors, and is looking to expand its business
throughout Asia. Cherak has some innovative pen test result reporting
systems which integrate with client software fault and vulnerability
tracking systems, and it actively looks for methods to provide
additional value to its clients. Cherak has identified that pen test
clients would benefit from help to in understanding the effects of
combinations of vulnerabilities, especially design flaws, and has
decided to utilise the **OWASP Automated Threat Handbook** to define and
explain the automation-related threats. The individual vulnerabilities
were scored as normal using CVSSv2 and v3, the matching CWEs identified,
and mitigations in place documented. In addition, Cherak uses the threat
events defined in the **OWASP Automated Threat Handbook** to help create
a new section in the executive summary that explains how combinations of
the issues found could lead to automation threats and the possible
technical and business impacts. For example, an assessment for one
client had identified weaknesses in authentication so that there is a
risk of **OAT-008 Credential Stuffing**. The defined identifier was
provided to the client, so its technical staff could refer to additional
information on the OWASP website.

## Specifying service acquisition needs

Falstone Paradise Inc is concerned about malicious use of their
portfolio of hotel and resort websites. The majority of the websites use
a shared application platform, but there are some unique applications
and a large number of other micro-sites, some of which use generic
content management systems such as Wordpress and Drupal. Falstone
Paradise has identified that its IT operations team are spending too
much time dealing with the effects of automated misuse, such as cleaning
up data, resetting customer accounts and providing extra capacity during
attacks. Furthermore, the unwanted automation is also causing some
instabilities leading to negative feedback from customers. Therefore
Falstone Paradise decides to go out to the security marketplace to
identify, assess and select products or services that might help address
these automation issues for all its websites. Their buying team works
with their information technology colleagues to write the detailed
requirements in an Invitation to Tender (ITT) document. This describes
the types of attacks its web applications are receiving, their frequency
of occurrence and their magnitudes. These are defined according to the
**OWASP Automated Threat Handbook**, so that vendors do not
misunderstand the requirements, and each vendor's offering can be
assessed against the particular automation threat events of concern.

## Characterising vendor services

Better Best Ltd has developed an innovative technology to help gaming
companies defend against a range of automated threats that can otherwise
permit cheating and distortion of the game, leading to disruption for
normal players. The solution can be deployed on premises, but is also
available in the cloud as a service. But Better Best is finding
difficulty explaining its solution in the market place, especially since
it does not fit into any conventional product category. Better Best
decide to use the terminology and threat events listed in the **OWASP
Automated Threat Handbook** to define their product's capabilities. They
hope this will provide some clarity about their offering, and also
demonstrate how their product can be used to replace more than one other
conventional security device. Additionally, Better Best writes a white
paper describing how their product has been successfully used by one of
their reference customers Hollybush Challenge Games to protect against
**OAT-006 Expediting**, **OAT-005 Scalping**, **OAT-016 Skewing** and
**OAT-013 Sniping**.

## Comparison with other dictionaries, taxonomies and lists

### [Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification](https://capec.mitre.org/) (CAPEC)

![Ontology-chart-capec-wiki.png](Ontology-chart-capec-wiki.png
"Ontology-chart-capec-wiki.png")

CAPEC is a dictionary and classification taxonomy of known attacks on
software. Its primary classification structures are:

  - [Domains of
    attack](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/3000.html) (3000) -
    Social Engineering (403), [Supply
    Chain](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/437.html) (437),
    Communications (512),
    [Software](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/513.html) (513),
    Physical Security (514), Hardware (515)
  - Mechanism of Attack (1000) - Gather Information (118), Deplete
    Resources (119), Injection (152), Deceptive Interactions (156),
    Manipulate Timing and State (172), Abuse of Functionality (210),
    Probabilistic Techniques (223), Exploitation of Authentication
    (225), Exploitation of Authorization (232), Manipulate Data
    Structures (255), Manipulate Resources (262), Analyze Target (281),
    Gain Physical Access (436), Malicious Code Execution (525), Alter
    System Components (526), Manipulate System Users (527)

### [WASC Threat Classification](http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246978/Threat%20Classification)

![Ontology-chart-wasc-wiki.png](Ontology-chart-wasc-wiki.png
"Ontology-chart-wasc-wiki.png")

The WASC Threat Classification classifies weaknesses and attacks that
can lead to the compromise of a website, its data, or its users.

### [OWASP WASC Web Hacking Incidents Database Project](OWASP_WASC_Web_Hacking_Incidents_Database_Project "wikilink") (WHID)

WHID
[classifies](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S1536501YnLo)
publicly known incidents using:

  - attack methods e.g. ARP spoofing, abuse of functionality, account
    compromise, administration error, automation, backdoor, banking
    trojan, brute force, clickjacking, code injection, content
    injection, content spoofing, credential/session prediction, cross
    site request forgery (CSRF), cross-site scripting (XSS), denial of
    service, directory traversal, domain hijacking, DNS hijacking,
    forceful browsing, HTTP response splitting, hidden parameter
    manipulation, hosting malicious code, information leakage,
    insufficient authentication, known vulnerability, local file
    inclusion (LFI), malvertising, malware, malware injection, mass
    assignment, misconfiguration, OS commanding, parameter manipulation,
    path traversal, phishing, predictable resource location, process
    automation, redirection, remote file inclusion (RFI), rogue 3rd
    party app, scaping, search engine poisoning, shell injection, social
    engineering, stolen credentials, SQL injection, unintentional
    information disclosure, weak password recovery validation, worm
  - weakness e.g. abuse of functionality, application misconfiguration,
    directory indexing, improper filesystem permissions, improper input
    handling, improper output handling, information leakage, insecure
    indexing, insufficient anti-automation, insufficient authentication,
    insufficient authorization, insufficient entropy, insufficient
    password recovery, insufficient process validation, insufficient
    session expiration, insufficient transport layer protection,
    misconfiguration, predictable resource location, weak password
  - outcome account hijacking, account takeover, botnet participation,
    chaos, credit card leakage, data loss, defacement, DDoS attacks, DNS
    hijacking, DNS redirection, disinformation, disclosure only,
    downtime, extortion, fraud, information warfare, leakage of

# FAQs

  - What do you mean by "web", "application" and "automated threat"?
    See the definitions in the project's \#switchtablink:Project Scope
    and Definitions|glossary}}.

<!-- end list -->

  - What is an "ontology"?
    An ontology is a set of types, properties, and relationship. These
    together define a subject description language. This particular
    ontology is meant to represent what automated threats real world
    owners observe affecting their web applications in usual operations.

<!-- end list -->

  - Isn't this another bug (vulnerability) list?
    No, none of the named automated threat events are implementation
    bugs - they relate to abuse of functionality using automated means.

<!-- end list -->

  - But is it an OWASP Top N List?
    Again no, it's an ontology which currently contains 21 items but
    there may be more identified in the future. Also it is not an
    ordered list (like OWASP Top N lists) - the OAT identification
    numbers were randomly assigned, so the list is often written in
    alphabetical order to emphasize this.

<!-- end list -->

  - I thought "so and so" already did that?
    We found that it did not exist. While many threats are mentioned in
    the sources researched, there was no overall list or definitions. We
    found the automated threat events tended to all be in a small number
    of definied items from Mitre CAPEC and WASC Threat Classification.
    If you know of other automated threat lists/taxonomies/ontologies,
    please share them.

<!-- end list -->

  - What is an "oat"?
    It is our abbreviation for OWASP Automated Threat (OAT).

<!-- end list -->

  - I am confused and don't know which OAT my problem is - how do I
    identify it?
    In 2017 we created a [threat identification
    chart](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Oat-ontology-decision-chart.pdf)
    to help identify the correct OAT, which can then be confirmed by
    reading the full description in the
    [handbook](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automated-threat-handbook.pdf).
    The short summaries are important explanations of each OAT name.

<!-- end list -->

  - How can I help?
    Please join our mailing list, send ideas, contribute clarifications,
    corrections and improvement, and let other people know about the
    project and its handbook.

## Sponsors

All OWASP Projects are run and developed by volunteers and rely on
personal donations and sponsorship to continue their development. OWASP
does not endorse or recommend commercial products or services, allowing
our community to remain vendor neutral with the collective wisdom of the
best minds in software security worldwide. This project has received the
sponsorship part of their Corporate OWASP membership fees from Verizon
Digital Media Services in 2016 and Distil Networks in 2017, which has
already contributed to the v1.2 production design costs, and will also
be utilised to help promote knowledge of the project.

# Road Map and Getting Involved

Can you help? The project is looking for information on the prevalence
and types of automated threats seen by web application owners in the
real world. This will be used to refine and organise the information
gathered from research papers, whitepapers, security reports and
industry news. Please use the project's mailing lists to keep up-to-date
with what's going on, and to contribute your ideas, feedback, and
experience:

  - [Mailing
    list](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/automated-threats-project)

To share information confidentially, you can email the project leaders
directly: [Tin Zaw](mailto:tin.zaw@owasp.org) and [Colin
Watson](mailto:colin.watson@owasp.org).

## Completed Outputs

  - \#switchtablink:Scope and Definitions|Glossary}}
  - \#switchtablink:Bibliography|Bibligraphy of information sources}}
  - A [summary
    chart](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automated-threats.pdf)
    has been published summarising the information gathered and work to
    date
  - Identifying automated threats to web applications, and determining
    the primary name used. This first part of the project intends to
    produce a consistent vocabulary for discussing the threats before
    moving onto other aspects
  - The primary terms have now been defined and described for the
    ontology
