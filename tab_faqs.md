## Frequently Asked Questions

### What do you mean by "web", "application" and "automated threat"?
See the definitions in the project's [glossary](/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications#div-scope).

### What is an "ontology"?
An ontology is a set of types, properties, and relationship. These together define a subject description language. This particular ontology is meant to represent what automated threats real world owners observe affecting their web applications in usual operations.

### Isn't this another bug (vulnerability) list?
No, none of the named automated threat events are implementation bugs - they relate to abuse of functionality using automated means.

### But is it an OWASP Top N List?
Again no, it's an ontology which currently contains 21 items but there may be more identified in the future. Also it is not an ordered list (like OWASP Top N lists) - the OAT identification numbers were randomly assigned, so the list is often written in alphabetical order to emphasize this.

### I thought "so and so" already did that?
We found that it did not exist. While many threats are mentioned in the sources researched, there was no overall list or definitions. We found the automated threat events tended to all be in a small number of definied items from Mitre CAPEC and WASC Threat Classification. If you know of other automated threat lists/taxonomies/ontologies, please share them.

### What is an "oat"?
It is our abbreviation for OWASP Automated Threat (OAT).

### I am confused and don't know which OAT my problem is - how do I identify it?
In 2017 we created a [threat identification chart](https://www2.owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/assets/files/oat-ontology-decision-chart.pdf) to help identify the correct OAT, which can then be confirmed by reading the full description in the [handbook](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/tree/master/assets/files/EN). The short summaries are important explanations of each OAT name.

## How can I help?
